    "Thus, if one requires a solution to within a few percent, the Gauss method is computational more demanding. This is rather apparent given what is required: special legendre functions and weights - roots to those function. Whereas, the trapezoidal simply requires the integrand and a decent amount of sub-interval for a given region that is to be integrated. In either case, the quadrature method will give you an answer that's most acurate granted one takes the appropriate amount of polynomial degree for a given decimal requirement. "
